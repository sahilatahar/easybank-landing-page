## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tool

### What I learned

Over the course of my most recent practice sessions, I concentrated on improving my CSS abilities by exploring flex grid settings. My understanding of CSS layout techniques has been greatly improved as a result of my practical exploration.

I gained knowledge about how to make flexible and responsive web designs by experimenting with flex containers and their characteristics, such as display and flex-direction. Aesthetically pleasing layouts require an understanding of how to distribute and align pieces using justify-content and align-items.

Overall, this practice helped me to better understand CSS and gave me a strong basis for building interesting and eye-catching web pages.
